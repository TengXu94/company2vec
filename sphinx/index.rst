company2vec documentation
=======================================

Company2Vec is an open-source tool which enables to develop
a vector embedding of any company, given a company name. Company vector
embeddings can be used in many downstream commercial applications such as
lead generation, competitor analysis etc.

This package essentially combines a (free) Azure search API to find the URL,
scrapy to conduct a broad website scrape and some pre-trained GloVe embeddings
to generate the final company embedding.
